# 1. Physiopy Community and Community Practices Meetings

Welcome to physiopy! We are an international community of volunteers that meet monthly to discuss methods development of our tools and packages and to host discussions of Community Practices for physiological data acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis, in the scope of neuroimaging studies. The advice and recommendations presented in the following sections resulted from discussions conducted in previous Community Practices meetings and reflect the consensus reached by our community members. As these meetings are ongoing, we anticipate further updates and expansions in the future. 

Links to the labâ€™s websites of the members of our community are listed below if you wish to reach out with questions or look through any methods/analyses in their publications:

## What type of physiological data does the Physiopy Community work with?
The most common types of physiological data acquired within members of our community are cardiac (photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)) and respiration, either ventilation (respiratory belt) and/or gas concentration (particularly expired CO2). Typically, these are obtained simultaneously with the acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, which is the most widely used neuroimaging technique in our community. However, in certain instances, electroencephalography (EEG) is also recorded.

## When do we meet and how to get involved?
We meet virtually on zoom the third Thursday of every month at 16:00 UTC. To receive emails about our monthly meetings and planning surveys for topics to be covered please email physiopy.community@gmail.com. We are always looking for new members and contributors so if interested, please join us!
