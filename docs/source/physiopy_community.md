# 1. Physiopy Community and Community Practices Meetings

Welcome to physiopy! We are an international community of volunteers that meet monthly to discuss methods development of our tools and packages and to host discussions of Community Practices for physiological data acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis, in the scope of neuroimaging studies. The advice and recommendations presented in the following sections resulted from discussions conducted in previous Community Practices meetings and reflect the consensus reached by our community members. As these meetings are ongoing, we anticipate further updates and expansions in the future. 

Links to the labâ€™s websites of the members of our community are listed below if you wish to reach out with questions or look through any methods/analyses in their publications:

## What type of physiological data does the Physiopy Community work with?
The most common types of physiological data acquired in MRI analysis within members of our community are cardiac (photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)) and respiration, either ventilation (respiratory belt) and/or gas concentration (particularly expired CO2). 

## When do we meet?
We meet virtually on zoom the third Thursday of every month at 16:00 UTC. To join please email physiopy.community@gmail.com for the link.
